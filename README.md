In the 'Simulation' folder:

'1_para_ContinuousY.R' contains the codes in Section 11.1 of the supplementary material for illustrating the WEE method in the continuous outcome scenario when Assumptions (2.1)-(2.5) are satisfied. 

'2_para_BinaryY.R' contains the codes in Section 11.1 of the supplementary material for illustrating the WEE method in the binary outcome scenario when Assumptions (2.1)-(2.5) are satisfied. 

'3_para_Sen.R' contains the codes in Section 11.2 of the supplementary material for investigating the robustness of the WEE method when the treatment-independent missing assumption is violated.
